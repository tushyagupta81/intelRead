# PDF smart analysis

A smart PDF analysis tool powered by AI to read a pdf and give answer to questions with context to the given PDf.

It is powered by langchain and uses HuggingFace embedders and Google Gemini LLM model for better and clearer responses.

The PDF is embedded into vector which is then stored in a vector database that helps provide context to the answeres given by the LLM model.

Currently the frontend and backend are not connected but work fine independently.
